# ImGui Toolkit

A blueprint-friendly Dear ImGui integration for Unreal Engine.

‚ö†Ô∏è This plugin is still very early in development.

‚ö†Ô∏è This is the "project-version", it comes with an Unreal Engine 5.7.0 project and a few examples how to use the ImGuiToolkit plugin.

The goal of ImGuiToolkit is to make creating Dear ImGui interfaces for runtime debugging and editor tools in Unreal Engine as simple as possible.
It provides seamless integration between Unreal and Dear ImGui through easily bindable delegates in both C++ and Blueprint, and it automatically handles common type conversions for you (for example: FText ‚Üî const char*, FLinearColor ‚Üî ImVec4, and so on).

‚ÑπÔ∏è Note: ImGuiToolkit gives you full access to Dear ImGui‚Äôs capabilities in C++. In Blueprints, it offers a streamlined subset designed to help you build UIs faster and with fewer necessary decisions.

## Other TODOs

- [ ] ImGui windows should not always be rendered on top of Slate windows
- [ ] ImGui windows behind slate windows should not "steal" input
- [ ] Get copy+paste to work (InputText and others)
- [ ] Finish the ImGui Host EditorUtility Widget (ImGui window should also only be rendered when the host window is visible)
- [ ] Create useful real-world examples (one runtime and one editor tool)
- [ ] Add ImPlot support (with example)
- [ ] Add PluginSettings and expose properties like "Scale" and maybe even some style settings
